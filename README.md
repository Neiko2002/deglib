# DEG - Dynamic Exploration Graphs for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search and navigation in large image datasets
Header-only C++ DEG implementation with SIFT1M experiment.

### Introduction
No data visualisation or exploration code. 

### Highlights
1) Lightweight, header-only, no dependencies other than C++ 11.
2) Has full support for incremental index construction. Support for element deletions will be added in the future.
3) Can work with custom user defined distances (C++).
